## __Instructions__

To get started, clone or download the ZIP folder from (https://github.com/JameBlake/MyReads-A-Book-Tracking-App.git).

### __What do I do from here?__

Once you have the folder on your computer, please cd (change directory) into it.
Now that you are in this folder, please run npm install in the Command Line. When this installation is complete, start the app by running npm start. This will cause your browser to open up http://localhost:3000/ and the app will be fully functional.
You'll be able to see a variety of books on three different shelves.
You'll be able to move these books between shelves using the selector that is available on each book.
Upon clicking on the + sign located at the bottom right-hand corner of the app, you'll go to a search page and you'll be able to add new books to the My Reads main page.
Inputting text into the search bar will search for the books that match the query. The books in the result also have a selector which will allow you to move the chosen book onto one of the three shelves on the My Reads main page.
Clicking on the back key next to the search bar will return you back to the My Reads main page at any time. If any books were moved from the search page, they will be visible and be located on the shelf that was selected.
